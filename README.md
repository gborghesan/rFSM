rFSM Statecharts (v1.0)
=======================

What is it?
-----------

rFSM is a small and powerful Statechart implementation. It is mainly
used for *Coordination* of complex systems but is not limited to
that. rFSM is written in pure Lua and is therefore highly portable and
embeddable. As a Lua domain specific language rFSM inherits the
extensibility of its host language.

Documentation
-------------

See the [rFSM documentation](doc/rFSM-manual.md)

Information about how to use rFSM using the OROCOS RTT Framework can
be found
[here](http://www.orocos.org/wiki/orocos/toolchain/LuaCookbook).
